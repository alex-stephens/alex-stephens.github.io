Hey, I'm Alex! I grew up in Australia, but have recently moved to the UK where I'm working towards a PhD in Robotics at the University of Oxford.

Back home, I studied Mechatronic Engineering and Science (Physics & CS) at the University of Sydney. I've been fortunate to have had some incredible internship opportunities, including as a robotics researcher at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) in California and as a software developer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/).

My core research interests are in robotic autonomy and artificial intelligence, and more generally I'm interested in pretty much all things tech and space.

If you want to learn a bit more about me, check out my [bio](/about/) or [CV](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf). Feel free to contact me through any of the links below, I'm always keen for a chat!
