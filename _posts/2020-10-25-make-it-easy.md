## Life in the slow lane

When was the last time you picked up a new skill or habit that quickly became ingrained in your everyday behaviour?

Well, for me, it was a couple of months ago, when I learned the keyboard shortcut `shift + >` (or simply `>`) on YouTube, which increases the speed of the current video to the next increment (first 1.25x, then 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2x).

For quite a long time, I've been a fan of listening to podcasts sped up. Exactly how much I speed it up depends on the particular podcast - for some, I find 1.25x or 1.5x is more than fast enough, whereas others I can comfortably listen to at 2x. It also depends a bit on what I'm doing while listening - if I'm on a walk or run, my attention will be almost entirely on the podcast, so I can listen at higher speeds while I'm not listening, whereas if I'm cooking or driving my attention might be divided so I'll opt for slightly lower. I do always listen at at least 1.25x speed, as I prefer both the faster pace and the fact that it lets me listen to more episodes in the same time span.

I consume plenty of content on YouTube, be it informational, entertainment, or a combination of the two, but until recently I have never regularly adjusted the playback speed. The main reason for this is that the standard interface makes it pretty cumbersome, requiring three clicks through the menu to change speed once. My preferred speed for a given video could be anywhere from 1.25x to 2x, and the effort to switch between speeds for every video I watched was too much, so I never did it.

As soon as I learned the shortcuts (`shift + >` to increase speed by one increment, `shift + <` to slow down), it changed the game almost immediately. Suddenly, it was almost no effort to jump between different speeds and find the fastest comfortable one. No need to distract myself from the video by having to click through the menus - in fact, no need to even glance away from it while doing the adjustment. Since discovering this shortcut, I adjust the playback speed on virtually every video I watch, more or less without thinking, and the improvement to my overall YouTube experience has been huge.

## Make it easy

If you've ever ventured into the world of self-help and productivity literature, you've probably heard of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, which if you aren't familiar, is a great practical guide on how habits are built and maintained. In this book, Clear describes what he calls the Four Laws of Behaviour Change, the third of which is "Make It Easy". It is human nature to prefer actions that require less effort, so by making a habit easier to do, you become more likely to follow through with it.

Optimising my playback speed for videos was something that, on some level, I have wanted to do for a long time. However, that tiny extra effort of three clicks through a menu was enough to deter me from ever actually doing it. As soon as it became a single two-button keyboard shortcut, it became a habit that I am guaranteed to continue with for the foreseeable future.

Take the time to flick through the keyboard shortcuts for programs (or, in this case, websites) that you use all the time. Most of them probably won't stick, but those few that you do end up using constantly are the ones that make all the difference.
