title:  "The Rule of Six: An Unexpected Upside to Social Gathering Restrictions"
---

About a month ago, I moved from Australia to the UK to start a PhD at the University of Oxford. While I was quite excited for the move despite the uncertainty of relocating halfway around the world during a global pandemic, I still arrived with the expectation that I would not be able to have the usual social experience of a new student (a *fresher*, if you will) at Oxford.

One of the hallmarks of this experience is Freshers' Week, the week before the academic year starts, during which the colleges (one of which every student at Oxford is a member of) run the gamut of social events that you might expect for a bunch of uni students who want to make new friends - that is, a lot of drinking events, and a couple of other events that will probably end up involving drinking at some point too. In my case, the events were organised by the graduate student committee of Exeter College, catering to the 100 or so graduate students joining the college for the 2020-21 academic year.  

## The rule of six

This year, all of these events had to be organised in accordance with the UK Government health guidelines, most notably the  dramatically named "rule of six". As the name implies, this rule restricts all social gatherings to a maximum of six people in any setting - indoors, outdoors, public venues, private accommodation.

The rule of six meant that the Freshers Week events this year looked quite different than usual. Where there might previously have been rowdy parties, pub nights, or big outdoor gatherings, we now faced a series of events that were all carefully planned to comply with guidelines. Registration for events became essential, and any events at pubs or restaurants were limited to bookings of 6 with strictly no talking to people from other tables. Some events were designed around "household" groups, the small groups of students sharing living spaces at the college accommodation complex, who formed a social bubble within which COVID transmission was an accepted risk. The result was that all of the events essentially involved hanging out with the same small group of people for an entire afternoon or evening, with no mixing whatsoever with other groups.

Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to complain about any of this - in fact quite the opposite. It is obviously important to follow these rules, and my college cohort and I were extremely grateful that the committee went to the considerable effort of planning out all of these events for us under the challenging circumstances. At many of the other Oxford colleges, the freshers weren't so lucky, and essentially missed out on the Freshers' Week social experience altogether.

I actually came out of Freshers' Week feeling that I'd made a great number of friends and generally had an excellent time at all of the events, despite initial misgivings. However, this was initially tinged with the understanding that had there *not* been a global pandemic to contend with, it would have been even better. There was still some feeling that we'd missed out on something... But the more I thought about it in the days after, the more I realised that actually although the events might not have been as superficially exciting this year, they were actually a *better* experience for connecting with new people and making friends, which is exactly the point of Freshers Week.

## Social optionality

To understand how I came to the conclusion that social gathering restrictions improved my experience of Freshers Week, let's take a quick look at the idea of *social optionality*. I came across this concept in an episode of the podcast [Not Overthinking](https://notoverthinking.com/), in which Taimur Abdaal introduces the concept as a way of thinking about how we approach social interactions. He has a great blog post about it [here](https://taimur.me/posts/against-social-optionality/).

The social optionality of an event or situation refers to how easy it is to engage or disengage with particular social interactions. An example of a high social optionality situation might be a networking event or a large party, where everyone is meeting new people, and it's generally pretty easy to eject yourself from a conversation and move onto another one if you don't feel like you're hitting it off with someone. On the other hand, an example Taimur uses of a low optionality event is a group holiday, where a group of, say, 8 people go away for a couple of days, and are basically committed to engaging socially with each other for this time.

One of the key ideas that Taimur presents about this is that the social optionality of a situation significantly changes how we approach it. In a very high optionality scenario, we are often (consciously or subconsciously) evaluating new people we interact with - we are thinking, am I getting along with this person? Is this someone I want to become better friends with? If we're not convinced, it's easy to just move on and find someone else to talk to.

In low optionality events, this mindset doesn't work any more - we know that we *have* to interact with the people we are with, so we instead start thinking about *how* to connect with them. We throw away our superficial judgements about people, and look for common ground upon which to build a connection.

> Wanting to connect for no other reason than because you’re two human beings on the same floating rock — this is the intention with which I’d like to approach all social interactions.

Taimur concludes that the high optionality mindset causes us to miss out on making meaningful connections because we aren't necessarily putting in the effort, and that ideally we should approach all interactions with something akin to the low optionality mindset.

## The unexpected result

The conclusion I came to is that the effect of the UK Government's social gathering restrictions on my college's Freshers Week experience was precisely to *lower the social optionality of all of the events*. Had Freshers' Week involved, for example, a big wine and cheese night, I have no doubt that I would have had a great time, and probably chatted with loads of new people in the space of a few short hours. However, it's likely that many of these conversations would have been that typical awkward small talk that can dominate events where nobody knows each other, and I probably would've forgotten the names of most of the people I met by the following morning.

Instead, at pretty much all of the events I went to, I spoke for at least couple of hours with the same four or five people. While this might seem superficially less exciting than the wine and cheese night, I found that the conversations I did have were far better than what I would typically expect from talking to a group of people I'd just met and didn't necessarily have much in common with besides the university we attend. By the end of Freshers Week, I found that I have a whole lot of small groups of new friends whom I met at one of these events, each of which will now happily organise to hang out (responsibly, of course) and maybe bring along a new person or two if there's room. Since *every event* involved only a few people, I felt that I was able to connect better with new people, have more interesting conversations, and become closer than would otherwise have been possible.

So, strange as it might seem, for this one week that kicked off my new life as a PhD student in a foreign country, the government restrictions on social gatherings actually *improved* my social experience significantly. The social events, adapting to the challenging circumstances, turned into lower optionality situations which - although perhaps superficially less exciting at times - were genuinely more valuable because of it.
