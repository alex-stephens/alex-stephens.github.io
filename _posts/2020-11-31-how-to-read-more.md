title:  "Goodhart's Law: How Not to Read More Books"
---

Most of us have had the thought "I should try to read more" at some point in our lives, . In the current digital age, when there are so many things competing for our attention, it can be hard to just sit down and properly read a good old-fashioned book. It's not that I don't like reading - in fact, it's pretty clear to me that reading more good books would contribute a lot more to my life than spending more time browsing the internet - more just a problem of concentration.

In the last couple of months, I've been more or less able to re-establish my reading habit to a level that I'm happy with and confident that I will be able to maintain.  In this time, I've also tried to learn a bit about __how__ to go about reading more in an effective manner, as well as more generally how to establish habits that will stick.
This blog post is sort of a reflection on my habit changes in the last few months.

## Things that haven't helped
One of the common threads that comes up when you look for advice online on how to read more is videos or blog posts with titles like "How I Read 100 Books in a Year". Don't get me wrong, some of these are actually great, but I do feel that the way they are framed - with __reading more books__ as the primary goal - is somewhat problematic. When you approach reading with reading more books as the primary goal, there are side-effects that reduce the value of the reading, and might even eventually discourage us from reading as much in the long term.
The main problems I see arising from the goal of reading more books are:
* **Preference for shorter books**. Clearly, if you want to get through more books, you should pick shorter ones. Unfortunately, many of the great books out there are __not__ the short ones, and picking books using this heuristic will encourage you towards less interesting books.
* **Preference for easier books**. In the same vein as the last one, you'll get through books quicker if you can read them at full speed. The books that are easier to read will tend to be the ones that don't require much thought.
* **Unwillingness to slow down**. In all of the most impactful books I've read, the ones that really changed my view of the world, the best bits made me __slow down__. When you come across a passage, idea, or chapter that really resonates you, it makes sense to slow down and read it very deliberately, giving yourself time to properly think about what you're reading. Relatedly, discourages you from stopping to take notes as well.  
* **Aversion to rereads**

I don't think there are many people out there who would say "I don't want to read more books", yet it does seem like the goal of reading more books can be somewhat problematic.
The reason for this can be understood through a concept called [[Goodhart's law]], which ever since I first came across it i've which is sometimes expressed as follows:

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

The problem is that we set the goal of reading more books with good intentions, but as soon as we start changing our behaviour specifically to target that goal, we side-step many of the qualities that make reading valuable in the first place.

## Things that have helped
So the question now is, what __should__ you focus on if your aim is to read more? So far, I've found that the things that have helped me the most have been (a) making myself __want__ to read more, and (b) making it easier to read books that I want to read.

Some of the things that have helped me the most so far:
* **Giving up on books I don't like**. Over the years, I somehow acquired the ideas that books deserve some level of "respect" that we don't give to other media like news articles or YouTube videos, which usually meant finishing books that I'd started. In practice, this meant that once I got bored of a book halfway through, it would take me weeks or months to finish because I never felt like sitting down and reading, and as a result I'd read almost nothing during that time.
* **Skimming over the slow bits**. If you're reading a book that's several hundred pages long, chances are that even if it's a good book, not all of it is actually interesting or relevant to you. Nowadays, when I come to one of these points - perhaps a chapter that covers a general idea I'm already familiar with - I'll flick through it quickly, spending just enough time on each page to get the general idea. If something jumps out at me, I'll stop, but this realisation that skimming is a useful tool even in recreational reading has been a game changer. I've applied this one mostly to non-fiction so far, but I think it could help with some types of fiction as well.
* **Reading multiple books at a time**. What I feel like reading at any given moment can vary pretty wildly - maybe when I started on that 300 page book on the history of calculus it was what I was in the mood for, but that probably won't be the case every day for the next week or two. To overcome this dilemma, I've taken to starting new books without necessarily finishing the previous ones. This means that on a given day, I can read whatever I most feel like at the time, or start a new book if I'd rather do that. Again, I've only applied this to non-fiction books which didn't have too complex of an overarching narrative   
* **Having a reading list**. Keeping a proper database of books that I decided at some point I might like to read in the future has been super helpful to me. It means I'll never reach a point where I don't have anything I want to read next, and instead can always come up with a couple of books that I'm excited to start on.
* **Switching to digital**. This one probably isn't for everyone, but for me, switching to reading everything on Kindle has been great. It means that all of my books are in one place, I can take them anywhere really easily, and when I decide on a new book it takes me all of about 30 seconds to buy and download it. This has also helped a lot with the next point...
* **Taking notes**. What's the point of reading a (non-fiction) book if you're just going to forget it all? I've found that taking notes as I read, and then doing a bit of a reflection on the book afterwards, has helped me to engage a lot better with the books I read, and also meant that I can easily refer to my notes if I want to recall the key insights I got from each book.
* **Incorporating it into my daily routine**. This is typically the first bit of advice you'd hear on how to read more - "read a bit each night before bed", or something along those lines. Well, it's good advice, so there you go. Personally, I've made it a rule that I will read for at least 10 minutes every night right before I go to sleep. Not only is this a nice, relaxing way to end the day, but most of the time I end up reading for a fair bit longer anyway - as is often the case, the main thing is just showing up.

The main thing that ties all of these things together is that they all focus on the __process__ of reading, rather than the goal of reading more. In [[Atomic Habits]], [[James Clear]] gives this advice
> If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

Clear argues that the long-term positive behaviour change must rely on systems rather than goals - "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù The habits and attitude shifts listed above have meant that I read more in the last few months than I had at any point in the last few years. More importantly, however, my enjoyment of reading has increased a lot due to virtually eliminating the mental burden of getting through the books I read, and I am also able to get more out of them.

## How to read more

The upshot of all of this is that by eliminating as many of the barriers to reading more as possible, then adopting habits that make reading more fun and incorporating it into my daily routine, I have been able to read more, read better, and enjoy reading more.

Rather than focusing on macroscopic goals such as getting through a book per week, I've prioritised simply showing up each day, and creating a system that makes it easy to do so. Each day, there will be a book on my Kindle that I am keen to read more of, and without the self-imposed pressure to get through it quickly, I can read at a pace that maximises the enjoyment and value I get out of it.

There are definitely other avenues I'd like to explore with improving my reading habits, and habit development more generally. Lots of people swear by audiobooks these days - I personally have tried and enjoyed a handful of them, but mostly tended to prefer podcasts since they are freely available, while audiobooks are a little expensive for my liking. I also hope to experiment with some more "challenging" reads, in whatever form that might take, with the aim of exploring a little further into areas I might find interesting.
