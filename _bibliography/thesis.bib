    abstract={Recent developments in the capabilities of mobile robots have led to increasingly diverse applications in areas that are too dull, dirty or dangerous for humans. Subterranean environments such as mining facilities, cave networks and the urban underground are some of the most challenging for mobile robots, often involving complex unknown topologies, rough or unstable terrain, and degraded sensing and communication capabilities. The development of collaborative autonomous robots to effectively explore and map subterranean environments would assist in terrestrial applications such as disaster response or search and rescue, as well as provide unprecedented opportunities for exploration of other worlds.

Operations in  subterranean environments bring to light many domain-specific challenges for multi-robot systems. Current frameworks for multi-robot \acrfull{SLAM} are largely untested in environments with limited communications, repetitive structures and few distinct visual features. This thesis contributes to the development of a robust multi-robot SLAM system for subterranean exploration and mapping. Contributions include design and implementation of a modular and extensible system architecture for multi-robot SLAM in subterranean environments; development of a novel methodology for performance evaluation with sparse ground truth data; and implementation and testing of an algorithm for inter-robot data association under computational constraints.
